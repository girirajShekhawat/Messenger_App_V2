This front-end project is built with React and features a clean and user-friendly UI inspired by WhatsApp. The primary functionalities include the ability to chat with friends and search for friends within the application. React Hooks are utilized for efficient state management.


 


# Functionality
## Logged-in User
The application assumes a dummy logged-in user.

## Dummy Data
The project uses a JSON file to load dummy data. You can customize the data in the dummyData.json file.

## Search
Conversations can be searched by contact name using the search functionality.

## Left Sidebar
All conversations are displayed in the left sidebar.
Each conversation shows the contact name and some text from the last message.
All contacts are loaded from the dummy data file.
Clicking on a contact starts a new conversation (if none exists) or opens the existing conversation for that contact.

## Right Side View
Displays the messages for the currently selected conversation.
Allows the user to send messages in the conversation.

## React Hooks
React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) are used exclusively for state management.
